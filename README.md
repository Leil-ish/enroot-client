# Bibliofile Client

This is the frontend for a virtual library project called Bibliofile, found online at <https://leil-ish-bibliofile-app.now.sh/>! It allows users to:

* Search for books using an interface that pulls from the Google Books API

* Add those books (along with their descriptions, author and genre information, etc.) to a personal virtual library with one click

* Add books manually in the event that they cannot be found on Google Books

From the top:

* Click on the logout arrow icon to log out of your account.
* Click on the book icon to visit your library.
* Click on the magnifying glass icon to search for a book to add automatically.
* Click on the plus icon to add book details manually.

You may search for books to add by title, author, or ISBN number (but don't include the dashes in the ISBN). When you click "Add Book," the book will be added to your library for you to add notes to!

This project was created using React on the frontend and Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL on the backend. If you like this repo, you can find its backend companion at <https://github.com/Leil-ish/bibliofile-api>!
